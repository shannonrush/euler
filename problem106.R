# Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. 
# We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:
#     
# S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
# If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
# 
# For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies 
# the second rule.
# 
# Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which n = 4, 
# only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). 
# 
# Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.
# 
# For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?
