# It is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and still ensure that all points on the network remain connected.
# The network which achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a weight of 93, representing a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 
# from the original network.
# 
# Using network.txt, a 6K text file containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving 
# which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network remains connected.
