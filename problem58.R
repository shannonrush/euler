# but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
# If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along 
# both diagonals first falls below 10%?
