# Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
# multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
# 
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, 
# is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# 
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
